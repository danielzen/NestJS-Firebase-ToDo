## Description

This is the ToDo App backend from Robert Isaac's article:

* [Host a NestJS App on Firebase Functions: The Complete Guide](https://robert-isaac.medium.com/nestjs-with-firebase-the-complete-guide-aa0ade41cdef#44ca)

The ToDo App Angular frontend was also updated and is available [here](https://github.com/danielzen/ng-fire-todo)  

Note: I updated it to [Nest v10](https://github.com/nestjs/nest), Node v20, pnpm v9 and Firebase
Functions v5. I did
not change the code or the article in any other way, but hopefully this is
helpful to someone.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ pnpm run start

# watch mode
$ pnpm run start:dev

# production mode
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

## License

Nest is [MIT licensed](LICENSE).
